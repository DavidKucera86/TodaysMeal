# Today's Meal 

Portfolio project with React Router, React Query, React Icons and Styled Components.

## When you try the application (link below), you will see 3 sections:
- Home (loading and processing data from API (React Query + Axios)
- Movies (loading and processing data from local file, filtering items according to name, detail page with selected movie)
- Recipes (working with form, add & delete operation, inputs validation)


## In this project there are covered these issues:
- working with create-react-app and styled-components
- loading and processing data from API (React Query + Axios)
- loading and processing data from local file
- working with external React icons
- working with form, add & delete operation, inputs validation
- filtering items according to name
- responsivity

## You can:
- try application here: https://keen-gelato-babb2f.netlify.app/
- see code here: https://github.com/DavidKucera86/TodaysMeal

## Things that can be improved:
- working with Typescript
- working with database
- switching themes (light / dark)
- detail page for data from API
